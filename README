Simple (Yet Efficient) Encryption Tools

Description
-----------

Contains three simple tools dealing with encryption. Original written to help
me learn Windows' CryptoAPI. They're console based utilities. They would make
good reference code.

Please note that no hashing is done to ensure that the files are free from
errors.

Tools
-----

* srsakeygen.exe

Generates RSA 2048-bit public and private keys. It'll create 'private.key' &
'public.key' inside the working directory. These files are in the Windows key
BLOB format.

* sencrypt.exe

Uses AES 256-bit to encrypt passed files using a public key to encrypt the session
key. It'll use 'public.key' in the same location as the executable.
Files that it encrypts will have the extension '.enc' appended and it'll
remove the original file if possible.

* sdecrypt.exe

The opposite of the above.

Usage
-----

srsakeygen.exe takes no arguments.

The others two simply take a list of files that are to be processed. Wildcards
are supported. They'll skip files that appear to be already proccessed by
looking at the extension. From Windows Explorer, files can also be simply
dropped onto the executable.
